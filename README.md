# What is it?

A calendar web app based on the fullcalendar library. It is a Single Page Application. The full-calendar library provides modules in ES so it doesn't need Browserify or any other solution to show JS in the browser. 

This README is a work-in-progress. See the wiki tab or the issues for more details.
